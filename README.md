#### Elm REST client assignment

- This assignment is FAR ABOVE MY LEVEL so nothing works together and because the extremely sparse task description confuses me a lot. I do not know what exactly is expected. I can't build anything in Elm, I'm still struggling with just understanding the syntax in Elm.





#### SERVER: Build in Java 
- First I build a TCP server but don't think that was the expectation and don't know how it would work with the Elm client.

- Then I created a Counter-class 

- Then I created a Servlet that initilize the Counter-class



- Don't know what to do from here


#### CLIENT: Build in Elm

- Contains a button that increments everytime it is clicked at

- The number is showed in the div-box

- It imports Http but don't know how to use it and what to do from here
